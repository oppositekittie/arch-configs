# Awesome WM
Yes, I took multicolor from copycats and modified it too my presence. And also I got the icons from https://www.iconsdb.com/ also too put into the note, I only modified too work, I didn't look over the mess and fix how the code looks. I will try too fix this, but I personally don't care. 
In the future, or probably tomorrow I hope too rice freedesktop, but as of posting my config, I'm personally too lazy lmao.
